This repository contains two projects, PyBank and PyPoll, for the UT Bootcamp on Data Analysis and Visualization. 

## PyBank

PyBank is a revenue analysis on profits and losses for a company. I summarized information from a CSV to give the total months in the period, the total amount of profits and losses, the average change in profits and losses from month to month, the month/amount of the greatest increase in profits over the previous month, and the month/amount of the greatest decrease in profits over the previous month. This code prints the results to the terminal, and it also creates a file with the summary data. 

## PyPoll

PyPoll calculates the votes cast in a small town. It determines the total number of votes cast, the percentage of votes won by each candidate, and the overall winner. This code prints the results to the terminal, and it also creates a file with the summary data.
